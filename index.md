# Welcome to Claudiu's Virtual Cave !

With over seven years of practical experience in application and infrastructure administration and more than two years of hands-on experience in security operations related jobs, my primary objective is to leverage my cross-disciplinary skills to contribute in the realm of incident response, threat detection and malware analysis.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable insights into managing a large variety of infrastructures, including both on-prem and cloud based solutions. In my spare time, I enjoy sharpening my cybersecurity skills, gaining relevant certifications, participating in CTF exercises, coding and publishing in GitHub various useful tools.

Lsst but not least, I'm a true believer in the benefits of remote work, actively seeking roles that embody flexibility, productivity, and autonomy. Eager to contribute my skills to environments that align with these values and support a fully remote work setup.


### Enjoy !
